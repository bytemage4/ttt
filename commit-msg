# Git hook to remove Claude Code attribution lines from commit messages
#
# This hook removes the last two lines if they match:
# - "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)"
# - "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1

# Create a temporary file
temp_file=$(mktemp)

# Process the file line by line, removing the specific lines
grep -v "🤖 Generated with \[Claude Code\]" "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE" | \
grep -v "Co-Authored-By: Claude.*<noreply@anthropic.com>" > "$temp_file"

# Remove trailing blank lines using a Python one-liner (more portable)
